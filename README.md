# ForSyde IO Graph Representation and DFB Component Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains files related to the ForSyde IO graph representation and the re-implementation of the original DFB component. It showcases the use of the ConverSyde tool and inline-C library in embedding C functions into Haskell programs.

## Files and Folders Description

### Graph Representation

- `dfb.fiodl`: The original ForSyde IO model file.
- `DFB_IO.png`: A screenshot of the `dfb.kgt` graph, visually representing the ForSyde IO model.
- `dfb.kgt`: A graph representation of the ForSyde IO model, generated from `dfb.fiodl` using the ConverSyde tool.

### DFB Component Implementation

- `DFB_Shallow.png`: Visual representation of the DFB component implemented in ForSyde-Shallow.
- `dfb.fiodl`: Re-implementation of the original DFB component in ForSyde-Shallow.
- `dfb.c`: A C language re-implementation of the DFB component, including CSV file IO features.
- `output.csv`: Output file generated by applying test data to `dfb.c`.

### Inline-C Examples

- `inlineC/`: A folder containing three examples demonstrating the use of the inline-C library to embed C functions into Haskell programs.

## Usage

The files in this repository can be used for studying the graph representation of ForSyde IO, understanding the re-implementation of the DFB component, and learning about integrating C functions into Haskell programs using the inline-C library.

## Tools

- **ConverSyde Tool**: Used for converting `dfb.fiodl` into the `dfb.kgt` graph.
- **Inline-C Library**: Facilitates embedding C functions into Haskell programs, as demonstrated in the `inlineC` folder.
